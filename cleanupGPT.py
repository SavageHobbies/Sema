# User  I am going to give you some code, and I want you to make it more beautiful and maybe add some new functions

# GPT improvements 
#Let's refine and enhance your code by improving readability, structure, and functionality. Here's a beautified version of your code with some added functions:

#Comments: Add comments to make your code more understandable.
#Functions: Encapsulate repetitive logic into functions for better reusability and clarity.
#String Formatting: Use f-strings for more readable and concise string formatting.
#Validation: Improve input validation for robustness.

# Arithmetic operations
print(10 / 3)   # Division
print(10 // 3)  # Floor Division
print(10 % 3)   # Modulus
print(10 ** 3)  # Exponentiation
print(10 + 3)   # Addition

# Incrementing variable
x = 10
x += 3
print(x)

# Check temperature and give recommendations
def check_temperature(temperature):
    if temperature >= 30:
        print("It's hot")
        print("Drink water")
    elif temperature > 20:
        print("It's nice")
    else:
        print("It's cold")
        print("Wear warm clothes")

temperature = 35
check_temperature(temperature)

# Convert weight between Kilograms and Pounds
def convert_weight(weight, unit):
    if unit.upper() == "K":
        converted = weight * 2.20462  # From Kg to Lbs
        print(f"Your Weight in Lbs is {converted:.2f}")
    elif unit.upper() == "L":
        converted = weight / 2.20462  # From Lbs to Kg
        print(f"Your Weight in Kg is {converted:.2f}")
    else:
        print("Invalid input")

weight = float(input("What is your Weight? "))
unit = input("(K)g or (L)bs: ")
convert_weight(weight, unit)

#Enhancements:
#Functions: check_temperature and convert_weight functions are created to encapsulate specific functionalities, making the code more organized and reusable.
#Input Validation: Weight is now read as a float to handle non-integer values. The unit input is validated by checking both 'K' and 'L' in uppercase, making it case-insensitive.
#String Formatting: Used f-strings for cleaner and more readable string outputs.
#Constants: The conversion factor for weight conversion is used as a constant (2.20462) for better readability and maintainability.
